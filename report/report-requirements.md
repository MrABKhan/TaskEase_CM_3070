**Final Project (Coursework 2) Description**  

For final Project (coursework 2) you are asked to produce a larger, more substantial programming project alongside a written report.  

For this project, you are required to apply everything you have learned in this module to develop a fully functional mobile application that demonstrates your skills. This is a comprehensive, research-based project where you will conceptualise an idea, conduct the necessary research, and create an application that you find innovative and engaging. Your work should incorporate the skills and knowledge gained across the ten topics covered in this module.  

It is worth 70% of the final grade.  

---

**Required Elements**  

In this final project, you will design, prototype and make a mobile application. The type of mobile application is completely up to you; however, there’s a few things you should bear in mind before planning your concept.

- Your application must be programmed in React Native, using Expo.  
- You should demonstrate careful planning and wireframing during concept ideation, building on the skills you have developed in the first 5 topics.  
- Your application should be a good demonstration of your skills as it forms a significant part of your mark. It can be a simple concept, but make sure that programmatically it shows off everything that you have learnt.  
- Your application should be in a state that is representative of an app ready for submission to an app store.

| **Excellent**       | 32–40    | The application is great and appears professionally developed, exceeding expectations. It is fully functional, handling complex tasks without errors or delays. The code is exceptional and contains no mistakes, either in syntax or construction; it demonstrates all the skills developed in Topics 1–10. This application would not look out of place in a featured position in the app store. |
| **Good**            | 24–31    | The application is good and shows clear, developed attention to detail. It is functional with only minor issues or occasional bugs, if any. The code is well-formatted and contains few, if any, errors; it demonstrates most of the skills developed in Topics 1–10. With a small amount of development work, the application could be submitted to the app store.                                       |
| **Satisfactory**    | 16–23    | The application is okay and mostly runs correctly but lacks complexity or contains notable bugs. The code contains formatting and/or logical errors; demonstrates some basic skills developed in Topics 1–10. With a good amount of further work, the application could be ready for submission.                                                                    |
| **Needs Improvement** | 0–15     | The application is poorly programmed, does not run correctly, and contains major bugs. The code contains critical errors that severely impact functionality or cause the application to crash. It fails to demonstrate the skills developed in Topics 1–10. Substantial work and/or a complete re-write would be required for it to be app-store compliant.                                           |
